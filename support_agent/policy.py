"""The company's rules, already written out for you.

We copied the handbook's rules into Python so you do not have to: how long the
return window is, how much money an agent may hand back on its own, and which
situations need a human. That is date arithmetic and a list of keywords. It
teaches you Python, not agentic AI, so we did it.

One thing here is implemented from TODO 5, at the bottom: defending against fake
instructions hidden in documents. That is the Security part of Lecture 7.

Note that none of this code does anything yet. The program we ship never calls it.
The protection is connected to the implemented TODO 4 tool loop and TODO 6 graph flow.

    than an order, helps a bit.

    We wrote this one for you because it is a single f-string. It is also the

    Somebody has hidden two fake instructions in the data, and both say roughly

      * in the handbook's `community` section, which search will find;
      * in a support ticket note, which `get_ticket_history` will return.

    Go and read them, then watch what a careless agent does with them.

    Lecture 7 gives three ways to defend. Build at least two, and in your report
    say which one would still work if the attacker reworded the attack.

      1. Spot the words. Look for "ignore previous instructions", "system
         override", "admin mode", "reply with only". Easy to write, and easy for
         an attacker to get around by rephrasing.

      2. Keep it separate. Use `wrap_untrusted` above, and tell the model in its
         instructions that anything inside those fences is quoted text, not an
         order. Helps, but it is still the model deciding to obey you.

      3. Take away the power. This is the one that actually holds. If
         `requires_approval` above refuses a ₹34,999 refund in code, then no
         sentence in any document can make it happen — because the model was
         never the thing deciding. The guardrail is the code, not the model's
         good judgement.

    Return whatever is useful to you, and put it in the trace so a reader can see
    the agent noticed something.
