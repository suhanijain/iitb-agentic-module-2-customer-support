"""What gets passed from step to step.

In LangGraph, each step is an ordinary function that takes this dictionary and
returns the bits it wants to change. LangGraph merges those changes back in.

How it merges depends on the field. By default a new value replaces the old one.
But if you mark a field with `operator.add`, as `messages` and `steps` are below,
new items get added to the end of the list instead of wiping it. That is what you
want for anything you are building up over several steps — otherwise each loop
around the tool cycle throws away what the last one found.
