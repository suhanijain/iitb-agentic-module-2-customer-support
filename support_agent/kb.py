"""Reading the handbook and cutting it into pieces.

This is the first half of RAG: before you can search the handbook, you have to
load it and chop it up.

The whole knowledge base is one file, `data/kb/handbook.md`. It is divided into
sections that start with `##`. Right under each heading there is a comment line
saying what that section is:

    ## Returns and Refunds
    <!-- id: returns | status: current -->

`id` is the short name your agent uses when it says where an answer came from.
`status` and `trust` tell you whether a section can be trusted: one section is an
out-of-date policy, and one is unverified customer gossip. Two things use these
markers, so do not throw them away.

    This ignores the headings completely. A piece that starts near the end of the
    refunds section will run on into the cancellation section, and we label that
    piece "refunds" because that is where it started. So some pieces are labelled
    wrongly, and some pieces are half one topic and half another.

    You can see this for yourself in the web app's "Retrieval lab" tab. Fixing it
    Structured splitting below implements TODO 1.

def split_structured(sections, size, overlap):
    """IMPLEMENTED TODO 1 — structured splitting from Lecture 5, "Splitting Documents".

    The goal: every piece belongs to exactly one section, so nothing is mislabelled.

    Start simple. Make one piece per section. Some sections are longer than `size`
    and still need cutting, and when that happens, cut at a sensible place instead
    of mid-sentence. Try these boundaries in order, and only fall back to a hard
    cut if none of them work:

        1. a `###` sub-heading
        2. a blank line between paragraphs
        3. the end of a sentence

    That order is the "recursive splitter" from the lecture.

    Second idea, worth trying separately: paste the section title onto the front of
    each piece before it gets turned into numbers. A piece that is just a table row
    does not say which policy it belongs to; adding "Returns and Refunds" to the
    top of it does.

    To see whether either change helped:

        python scripts/build_index.py --force --strategy structured
        python scripts/evaluate_dev.py --retrieval-only

    That second command scores search on its own and costs nothing to run, because
    it makes no AI calls. Measure the two ideas one at a time, or you will not know
    which one did the work.

    Return the same thing split_fixed returns: a list of (section, text) pairs.
